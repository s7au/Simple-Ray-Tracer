# Simple-Ray-Tracer
Simple code for what a simple ray tracer might look like.
Code is not meant to compile on its own.

This is a fairly downsized version of a raytracer solely meant to be used as a reference. I had to make a raytracer for a course and honestly I got through it by looking at bits of pieces of online examples so hopefully this helps someone else.

The findIntersection function is probably where the bulk of the work lies and probably varies the most between ray tracers so that part of the code was not included.

https://www.scratchapixel.com/ was very helpful for understanding a lot of the concepts and for implementing interesting stuff like soft shadows, reflection, refraction, etc.


Here are some examples of pictures I rendered:
